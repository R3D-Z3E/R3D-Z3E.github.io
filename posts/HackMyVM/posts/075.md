As usual i started scraping path of the image to paste on google, the methodology i have formed over time is to either split the image into four parts or pick up a more detailed place in the image given

The image seems a little bit dull so i got a brighter one from [here](https://en.tripmydream.com/france/paris/weather) by just pasting this same image on google

Copying the major part of this image i got a more clearer description of where this would be using this [blog](https://www.imageprofessionals.com/en/images/13936035-France-Paris-Saint-Michel-district-old-houses-Rue-Galande-n)

The blog says "**France, Paris, Saint Michel district, old houses Rue Galande**" and according to chatgpt


> it is a historic street located in the Saint-Michel district of Paris, France. It is situated on the Left Bank of the Seine River in the 5th arrondissement, near the Latin Quarter. This area is known for its charming old houses, narrow streets, and vibrant atmosphere, reflecting the rich history and culture of Paris.

Now let use Google map to find the exact place, I will start by pasting the street name "**Rue Galande**" since that is where it is located

Zooming in we finally have an intersection, The horizontal rule as shown in the image below is the street "**Rue Galande**", while the vertical one is called "**Rue Dante**"

We are interested in "**Rue Galande**" so let zoom in and explore more, I will have to show you a video since taking pictures would just make it confusing, so enjoy:
