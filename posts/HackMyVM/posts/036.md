I was given this image to find the BSSID of which i don't know by [sh4dowExe](https://hackmyvm.eu/profile/?user=sh4dowExe)

First of all we all know a **_SSID_** is an abbreviation for service set identifier, which is an important identifier for wireless networks. Essentially, an SSID is the name assigned to a Wi-Fi network when a router is typically set up.


## Then what is a **_BSSID_** ?



**BSSID** stands forÂ **Basic Service Set Identifier**, and it's the MAC (Media Access Control) physical address of the access point or wireless router that is used to connect to the WiFi.


So we typically need to find the MAC address of a particular wifi in that JPEG. Checking the image metadata looks like a legitimate image with no modifications

However copying the top most part of this image and pasting on google we have this

Everywhere literally screams **"sunlive"** and google told us the full name is **"Sunlive Moritsune"** and it is a shopping mall, I also found their [**e-commerce**](https://www.sunlive.co.jp/shop/%E3%82%B5%E3%83%B3%E3%83%AA%E3%83%96%E3%82%82%E3%82%8A%E3%81%A4%E3%81%AD/) website that gives a map including other details.



Using G-maps i was able to get a better live view of this place confirming that this is truly **Sunlive**, also acording to the maps it looks like a really busy place where they could be public wifi

After much googling i found a website called https://wigle.net which is called WiGLE (or Wireless Geographic Logging Engine) used forÂ **collecting information about the different wireless hotspots around the world**. Users can register on the website and upload hotspot data like GPS coordinates, SSID, MAC address and the encryption type used on the hotspots discovered.


Without logging in we would check if we can truly find this location (also take notes that all purple dotted content are wifi connections in one way or the other)

So you can go ahead and create an account and log-in

After mapping out all nearby wifi in the building it turns out the correct BSSID is `00:3A:9A:7B:5F:40`
