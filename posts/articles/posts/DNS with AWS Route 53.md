## **Amazon Route 53 Routing Policies**

- **Route 53** is an intelligent DNS service.
- Routing policies determine which responses are provided to the client DNS resolver.

## **Types of Routing Policy**

| Routing Policy | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| Simple | Simple DNS response providing the IP Address associated with a name |
| Failover | If primary address is down (based on health checks ), routes to secondary destination |
| Geolocation | Uses geographic location  you're in (e.g Europe) to route you to the closest region |
| Geoproximity | Routes you to the closest region within a geographic area |
| Lateency | Directs you based on the lowest latency route to resources |
| Multivalue answer  | Returns several IP address and functions as a basic load balancer |
| Weighted | Uses the relative weights assigned to resources to determine which to route to |
