Welcome to the Batcave! As a junior pentester by day—and a cyber vigilante by night—I'm excited to reveal my thrilling tech missions. Here, you’ll find my most daring exploits, where I’ve tracked vulnerabilities like the Joker, breached systems with stealth, and fought digital crime. Suit up and dive into my projects, where every vulnerability is a hidden puzzle, and every exploit is another victory for justice in cyberspace! 🦇.
