Running our nmap scan we have 3 open ports

```bash

Navigating to port 80/HTTP we have a web application running on `openresty` version `1.21.4.1`

Viewing page source we don't have any important/juicy information :(

We can't also connect via `mysql` as it does not allow us, whereas running my nmap scan once more i discovered 2 new open ports ðŸ™ƒ (Always run your nmap scan twice while playing PG)

Checking port `9443` we have this page which **occurs when a browser sends a request to a web server that the server cannot understand or process correctly**

Checking port `43500` we have this page, saying Route no found

![](https://i.imgur.com/Thc6ro2.png)



However enumerating the `http-server-header: APISIX/2.8` i found there is an exploit for this on [exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50829?source=post_page-----5f920b22ccff--------------------------------) that leads to a Remote Code Execution vulnerability



![](https://i.imgur.com/CQxBdRw.png)


Checking crontab we can see that the user `root` runs `apt-get update` every minute


![](https://i.imgur.com/nxJqW3a.png)



We can create our own apt pre-invoke script in theÂ `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/` where the scripts are generally kept, first let's confirm if we have write access to this directory



![](https://i.imgur.com/2j6swJF.png)


Yes we do have write access, using this [article](https://systemweakness.com/code-execution-with-apt-update-in-crontab-privesc-in-linux-e6d6ffa8d076) as a guide i created a file named `00whatever` and put the below payload to grant the `/root` directory all permissions for all users


```
APT::Update::Pre-Invoke {"chmod -R 777 /root"};
```




![](https://i.imgur.com/yNwOdOa.png)



Running the below command we can see that we truly do have access

we can then regain the `proof.txt` flag as a normal user
