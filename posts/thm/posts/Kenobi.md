Checking port 80/HTTP we have this



![](https://i.imgur.com/MCIU09Z.png)




Checking port 139/445 SMB we have an anonymous share



![](https://i.imgur.com/enDBCOo.png)


We can go ahead and connect to it, in which we have a `log.txt` file, go ahead and download to our local machine


```bash
smbclient \\\\10.10.156.73\\anonymous

mget log.txt
```



![](https://i.imgur.com/aJBT4hi.png)



Checking the log file looks like some kind of FTP log, let enumerate ftp 



![](https://i.imgur.com/EH2C8Xa.png)



We can't connect via the anonymous user as the default password "`anonymous`", probably it has been changed



![](https://i.imgur.com/mYA5Al2.png)


Well, but lucky for us we have the version for the FTP server, **"ProFTPD 1.3.5 Server"**, Enumerating this version leads me to this [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49908)



![](https://i.imgur.com/YCgoLzk.png)



Although we have to make some little changes to this exploit, by changing the `cpfr` which is copy from command path to `/home/kenobi/.ssh/id_rsa` and command `cpto` which is copy to `/var/tmp/id_rsa`



![](https://i.imgur.com/36pR6IT.png)


> I am sorry if i am a bit too forward but i have enumerated the NFS share already, i found out that there is a writable share on `/var/tmp` that is why i decided to specify it in our exploit, the `/home/kenobi/.ssh/id_rsa` is from the `log.txt` file, Remember :D 



Go ahead and run the exploit


```bash
python3 exploit.py 10.10.3.223
```



![](https://i.imgur.com/SzsC4BS.png)


Now mount the NFS share on port 111



```bash
showmount -e 10.10.156.73

sudo mount -t nfs 10.10.156.73:/var ./mnt
```



![](https://i.imgur.com/t4RhpJb.png)


Go ahead and switch to the mounted NFS, then copy the `id_rsa` to wherever you want, Just copy it!!!


![](https://i.imgur.com/DvsU32N.png)



Go ahead and login as user kenobi with the `id_rsa` file



![](https://i.imgur.com/lg6DB5s.png)


Running `find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null` we have we have an unusual SUID binary `/usr/bin/menu`




![](https://i.imgur.com/VDNwrnm.png)



running this binary and choosing option 3 we can see that, the `ifconfig` binary is been ran, we can create our own `ifconfig` binary and use it to gain shell




![](https://i.imgur.com/70EwVlT.png)


We can go ahead and change directory to `/tmp`, create a file named `ifconfig`, grant it 777 permissions, export the `/tmp` path to PATH environment variable and run the `/usr/bin/menu` program selecting option 3 again and you should be root



```bash
# Create the file

cd /tmp
touch ifconfig
vim ifconfig

# COPY AND PASTE this

#!/bin/bash
/bin/bash -i

# HIT [ESC] key and then type in :wq to exit vim saving changes

# Export PATH

chmod 777 ifconfig
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH

# Run the program

/usr/bin/menu
3
```

Just a milestone to the Offensive Security Path, Have a nice weekend ðŸ˜„
